# Theater of the Mind - A [FoundryVTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com) Module

The original intent of this module was to provide a 'party view' feature that I found missing when I first started using [FoundryVTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com) instead of [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com). It will be updated with features that I personally want or need, or are requested of me by some poor soul.

## Features
- Adds a 'Party Sheet' similar to that provided by Fantasy Grounds. Just click the Party Sheet icon  on the Tokens Controls sub-menu.

## ALPHA Features
- Sound effects by Weapon Type on Attack Rolls.
    - This feature will be optional and off by default, until it's deemed solid and stable.
    - To enable this feature you must install both the [SyrinControl](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fvtt-syrin-control) and the [Attack Roll Check D&D5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/attack-roll-check-5e) modules.
    - When enabled, this module will scan for Attack Roll GM messages and play a sound with a matching weapon title (including hit, miss, and crit sounds if possible) through the SyrinControl module.
