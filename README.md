# Theater of the Mind - A [FoundryVTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com) Module

The original intent of this module was to provide a 'party view' feature that I found missing when I first started using [FoundryVTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com) instead of [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com). It will be updated with features that I personally want or need, or are requested of me by some poor soul.

Features:
    Adds a 'Party Sheet' similar to that provided by Fantasy Grounds.

TODO:
    Maybe Syrinscape support attack rolls and such.
