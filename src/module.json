  "description": "This system agnostic module will provide a GM with a 'party view' feature similar to that of Fantasy Grounds, online characters only, or all characters, configurable in settings, in order to quickly see important stats, traits, abilites, etc. It's a great tool for GMs running token/map games or Theater of the Mind style games.",
